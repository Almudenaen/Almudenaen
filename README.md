**Almudenaen/Almudenaen** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on small projects to include in my portfolio with the help of @Adalab.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about different Python libraries such as spaCy or Tkinter.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to quality assurance within the pharmacy industry.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with data analysis associated with AI.
